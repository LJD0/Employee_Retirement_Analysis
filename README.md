# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis
    Module 7 OSU_Bootcamp

## Overview

    A large number of Pewlett_Hackard employees will be retiring soon. This will lead to a drastic change in personal across several departments in the next few years. This outlook  determines a set of soon to be retiring employees that would be able to serve in a mentorship program that would allow an easier transition when the time to retire comes.

## Results

    * The first stage of the analysis was to find employees within Pewlett Hackard that were coming up to retirement age, and who had also retired. We then broke down that list to just those coming up on retirement by age, that were still employed with the company.

    * We queried to find the titles of employees approaching retirement to locate the departments in which the "silver tsunami" would affect the most.

    *   Of the total 72,458 employees approaching retirement the vast majority of them ~50,000 are Senior team members. Just over 25,000 are Senior engineers, just under 25,000 are Senior Staff. With that many Senior employees leaving the need for a mentorship program is apparent. 

    * There are 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program. Which allows for each employee in the program to get mentorship from several of the retiring staff. 


## Summary

    The eligibility for the mentorship program could be expanded. The selection process was determined by age, not by length of time with the company or by title. The number of employees naring retirement is substantially larger than the employees deemed elligible for the mentorship. As as there will be many more jobs available in the coming years than employees enrolled in the mentorship program, it would be logical to foster a program in which the large number of leaving employees is not leaving the company hierarchy dismantled.
